# @Terra's Editing Extensions
Improves the editing experience

Hello everyone!

The goal of this mod is to make creating missions easier. It massively extends the features of the debug console, the 3den Editor,  and the Config Viewer while creating no dependency for the client.

## Features:
- **Extended debug console**: Adds way more features to the escape menu in the style of the vanilla A3 debug console. It contains the following options:
   - Draw grids: Display a few lines on screen to give make orientation easier
   - Enable teleport: Look at your destination and hit SHIFT+T to teleport
   - Live debug: Create an onscreen dialog to let you watch over the expressions you entered in the watch fields of the vanilla debug console
   - Show icons over units: Track all units and vehicles present in the current scenario
   - Side player: Change sides on the fly
   - Enable target debugging: Show information about your cursor target in real time, add your own arguments and edit them
   - More watch fields: In case you got a hundred variables to track. You can theoretically track an infinite amount of arguments with this feature (though your game might crash or get unplayable after a certain amount). All of the commands will also be saved for later use.
   - Custom commands: Save your most used commands and keep them one click away
   - Recent Watch Entries: Keeps track of the commands you used in the Watch fields of the default debug console
   - Clear chat: Cleans up the chat so you can get an better overview of what's new
   - Change GUI Editor Grid: By selecting one of the two options you get an actually working grid for the GUI Editor
- **3den Editor**:
   - Find Object Type on Map: Creates a map marker and a 3D marker on the position of every object with the same class name. Useful to find certain house types.
   - Show Building Positions: Creates 3D markers on the positions of the building positions used with [buildingPos](https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/buildingPos).
   - **ezGUI**: A step by step introduction to dialogs.
   - Structured Text Editor: Create structured texts with live preview.
   - Font Picker: Preview all fonts available ingame (including mods).
   - Color Picker: Find the correct color with multiple export options.
- **Misc**:
   - Export button for the CfgViewer: Export the currently selected config with a single click!
   - Escape shortcuts: While in the escape menu you can press STRG+R to restart the mission or STRG+E to exit it.



Greetings,
