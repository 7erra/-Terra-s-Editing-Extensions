//--- Description
"This control gives you the possibility to display a model (.p3d). It can be interacted with via the commands and EHs. Normally controls are listed in the controls or controlsBackground class of the dialog but there is another one which is Objects. This is also the reason why there is no example as they are created via the ctrlCreate command. KillzonKid made an <a colorLink='#5555FF' href='http://killzonekid.com/arma-scripting-tutorials-gui-part-6/'>example on his website</a> if you want to see it in action.",
