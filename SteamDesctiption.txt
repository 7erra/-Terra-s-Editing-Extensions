[h1]7erra's Editing Extensions[/h1]
Hello everyone!

The goal of this mod is to make creating missions easier. It massively extends the features of the debug console, the 3den Editor,Â and the Config Viewer while creating no dependency for the client.

[b][u]Debug Console[/u][/b]
As of v2 there are so many features that they will be explained in detail on the GitHub page. Here is a brief overview over the most important improvements:
This tool will be shown alongside the vanilla debug console. It contains several sections with different small and big improvements. Most noteably are:
[list]
[*]More watch fields: Just like the vanilla debug console these lines can evaluate expressions in real time without having a restriction to how many there are at any given time
[*]GUI Editor Fix: Makes the GUI Editor usable again and further improves the experience with easy to setup configuration
[*]Saving Watch Lines: If you ever run out of watch lines on the vanilla debug console but still need some expressions for later this tool has your back
[*]Unit Live Watch: Track units in real time with a camera
[/list]

[b][u]3den[/u][/b]
Tools for 3den can be found under "Toolbar >> Tools >> 7'3 Editing". Those include
[list]
[*]Modern Config Viewer
[*]Structured Text Editor
[*]Color picker (RGBA, Texture, config, HTML)
[*]Font picker
[*]attachTo Finder
[*]DIK Codes
[*]Control Types Explained
[*]Namespace Variables
[/list]
The context menu gets some additions too:
[list]
[*]Show types: Finds the selected object type on the map and marks it with a map marker and a 3D symbol
[*]Show Building Positions: Draws icons on the positions of a building
[*]Export Marker as String: Copies a marker to the clipboard which can be used with BIS_fnc_stringToMarker saving several lines of code
[*]Clear Inventory: Remove the entire loadout from a unit to start from scratch
[/list]
